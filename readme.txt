Simple image protection plug-in designed to make it a little more difficult to steal your pictures.

== Description ==

It can be annoying when people steal your pictures, just because they can't be bothered to invest in something on their own. Well... That's the theory, at least. Personally, I view the web with a very CC-BY-SA attitude, but if you are an artist, graphic designer, photographer or similar then I can appreciate this makes your life a little difficult.

I have put this plug-in together to help discourage those people who refuse to play nice.

*This is not a fool-proof method - nothing is!*

It doesn't matter what you do - if you put something on the web then someone else will be able to take it. You can't stop it. If you don't like that, don't put it on the web.

Anyway... this plug-in attempts to confuse the would-be-pilferers by overlaying a transparent gif over any images you embed in your main blog content. Simple enough.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `iprotect` directory and all files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can people still steal my pictures? =

Yes - there is no practical way to prevent someone from stealing your images. All this does is make it a little more confusing for non-technical users.

= Why bother, then? =

Actually, sometimes making things a little more difficult is sufficient. Ever heard the phrase, "Laws exist to keep honest people honest."? Enough said.

= What is the cost? =

There is no cost for the plug-in (obviously), but it does process each post as it is being loaded to display, so there is increased server load. This is negligable for a single post, but on a busy server you might want to do some benchmarking if you are considering this type of thing.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial build of the plug-in; this is very alpha
